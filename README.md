# Ethical Code

## What is this
Here we'll be documenting the founding of Ethical Code, a group of Australian Designers, Developers, Machine Learning Enginers and Organisers who are committed to doing both politics and software development better.

## Why are we starting this?

We've worked in the Politics & NGO sector in Australia and the US. We've worked in agencies, political parties, big and small NGO and we've experienced the frustration from both sides. We know there's a better way
We've also seen our friends and colleagues try to volunteer their skills for these orgs, but not get the kind of recognition, reward, focus and great project management they get when they take part in traditional community organising. 
We've seen PhDs knocking doors and making phone calls (which is great, don't stop! Persuasive conversations can change the world), and wished that they were spending their time working with like minded high-skill volunteers to build things that could reach hundreds of thousands or millions of voters.

## How are you different?

Ethical Code has organising at its' heart. We think our community will thrive when it's focused on solving real problems, grounded in great user research, respects and rewards contributors and has close ties to the people who are using their work every day.

### Inspiration
We love [https://www.progcode.org/](Progcode), with all its anarchy, enthusiasm and talent. We love [https://www.techforcampaigns.org](Tech4Campaigns), with its great project management, close relationships with candidates and laser focus.
We'd like to take the best of these and build a community that makes stuff that is
* **World Changing -** We'll only work on projects that solve a big problem for a tonne of people. We do this because weâ€™re always going to be resource constrained (Great volunteers are scarce)
* **Open -** Because when we solve a big problem well, we want to make sure that the benefit accrues to as many people and organisations as possible, and that they're incentivized to keep making it better
* **Self Hosted -** We'll build apps that organisations can deploy themselves, at low cost.
* **Painless -** Everything we build will be deployable and usable by a talented organiser of average to above average technical ability
* **Scalable -** In general, we won't do 'custom' work for a single organisation. We'll aim to build tools so good that 10s or hundreds of orgs can use them to solve their problem. [^custom]

## I have an idea for a project!
Great! If you're a practitioner inside a values-aligned NGO or Political party, we'll sit down with you and help you define and document the problem you're trying to solve inside your org. If you're a contributor, we'll connect you with someone inside an NGO or political party and one of our project leaders, so that you can get a sense of the problem space and we can start co-designing a solution. We'll also help you find people inside the Ethical Code community to help you build it.



[^custom] If you're an organisation with really bespoke needs, we'll help you find an amazing team to extend one of our existing open source tools to solve your bespoke problem, but we'd prefer to help you figure out how to get away from the vendor lock-in you're in and join the open campaigning technology world. No matter how large you are, you'll benefit from the ecosystem of great open apps and technologies like [https://www.opensupporter.org](OSDI) that will help you liberate your data and stand on the shoulders of giants.
